 Since we can use any
  string as a label, 
 it's a common practi
 ce to add a few lett
 ers to the label (as
  prefix) to indicate
  what is being label
 ed. This becomes imp

  different types of 
 objects are referenc
 ed in a document, as
  it might be useful 
 to remember the kind
  of object a label r
 efers to it. Besides
 , it also makes it p
 ossible to reference
  different kind of o
 bjects using a commo
 n string.
